Description: Package contains functions calculating ratings for two-player or multi-player challanges. Methods included in package are able to estimate ratings (players strengths) and their evolution in time, also able to predict output of challenge. Algorithms are based on Bayesian Approximation Method, and they don't involve any matrix inversions nor likelihood estimation. Weights (parameters) are updated sequentially, and computation doesn't require any additional RAM to make estimation feasible. Additionally, base of the package is written in `C++` what makes `sport` computation even faster.
